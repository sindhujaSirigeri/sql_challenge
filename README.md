 A challenge at the capacity of a data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company).
## Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project

### Introduction
Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project! In this project, we will design tables to hold data from six CSV files containing information about employees of Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. The project involves data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis tasks.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to import the CSV files into a SQL database, design appropriate tables to store the data and perform data analysis to answer specific questions about the employee data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

### Data Modeling: 
Designing the tables to hold the data from the CSV files.

### Data Engineering: 
Creating the tables in a SQL database and importing the CSV files into the database.

### Data Analysis: 
Answering questions about the employee data using SQL queries.

### Files
data/: This directory contains the CSV files with employee data from the 1980s and 1990s.
schema.sql: SQL script to create the tables in the database and to import the CSV files into the database
queries.sql: SQL script containing queries to analyze the employee data and answer specific questions.

### Instructions
Set up Environment: Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed on your machine.
Create Database: Create a new PostgreSQL database for the project.
Run SQL Scripts: Execute the schema.sql script to create the tables in the database and import the CSV files into the database.
Perform Data Analysis: Use the queries.sql script to run SQL queries and analyze the employee data.
Review Results: Review the results of the data analysis to gain insights into Pewlett Hackard's employee data from the 1980s and 1990s.

### Conclusion
By completing this project, I gained valuable experience in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL. Feel free to explore the data further and conduct additional analyses as needed.
